# Personal Projects
---

This Repo contains my personal C++ projects made in free time besides projects made for AGH UST.
I'll add here projects including Qt framework, Boost, OpenSSL and STL (including code made for courses).

##### 1. Hello World
Added by me just to be a memory of a journey with Qt. This program does nothing except displaying Hello World in a simple window.
